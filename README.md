# frontend-nanodegree-portfolio
Project #1 - Portfolio Site

I used bootstrap 3 to make this site. Navbar and modal implementation was taken from the bootstrap documentation. I worked on this project while I was taking Intro to HTML and CSS.
Now that I'm signed up for the nanodegree officially, it's time to submit it. Thank you!
